# Identification of Recyclable Materials Through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks in Python 

*Abstract - According to the US Environmental Agency, the recycling rate has increased from about 7% to over 32% in the US over the past 60 years but even with that progress over 40% of waste that could still be recycled is thrown in the trash instead. One of the problems that is preventing additional recycling is that many Americans are unsure of what can be recycled. Our project looks to address this problem with an easily accessible model that consumers could utilize to identify recyclable materials. Making the identification of recyclable materials easier will help to minimize recycling confusion.*


Our group chose to address this problem through the development and deployment of a convolutional neural network model with transfer learning in Python to identify recyclable materials
